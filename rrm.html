          He was born in British-ruled Bengal to a prosperous family of the
          Brahman class (varna). Little is known of his early life and
          education, but he seems to have developed unorthodox religious ideas
          at an early age. As a youth, he traveled widely outside Bengal and
          mastered several languages—Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, and English, in
          addition to his native Bengali and Hindi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roy supported himself by moneylending, managing his small estates, and
          speculating in British East India Company bonds. In 1805 he was
          employed by John Digby, a lower company official who introduced him to
          Western culture and literature. For the next 10 years Roy drifted in
          and out of British East India Company service as Digby’s assistant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roy continued his religious studies throughout that period. In 1803 he
          composed a tract denouncing what he regarded as India’s superstition
          and its religious divisions, both within Hinduism and between Hinduism
          and other religions. As a remedy for those ills, he advocated a
          monotheistic Hinduism in which reason guides the adherent to “the
          Absolute Originator who is the first principle of all religions.” He
          sought a philosophical basis for his religious beliefs in the Vedas
          (the sacred scriptures of Hinduism) and the Upanishads (speculative
          philosophical texts), translating those ancient Sanskrit treatises
          into Bengali, Hindi, and English and writing summaries and treatises
          on them. The central theme of those texts, for Roy, was the worship of
          the Supreme God who is beyond human knowledge and who supports the
          universe. In appreciation of his translations, the French Société
          Asiatique in 1824 elected him to an honorary membership.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1815 Roy founded the short-lived Atmiya-Sabha (Friendly Society) to
          propagate his doctrines of monotheistic Hinduism. He became interested
          in Christianity and learned Hebrew and Greek in order to read the Old
          (see Hebrew Bible) and New Testaments. In 1820 he published the
          ethical teachings of Christ, excerpted from the four Gospels, under
          the title Precepts of Jesus, the Guide to Peace and Happiness.
        </p>
        <h4>Social And Political Activism</h4>
        <p>
          In 1823, when the British imposed censorship upon the Calcutta
          (Kolkata) press, Roy, as founder and editor of two of India’s earliest
          weekly newspapers, organized a protest, arguing in favour of freedom
          of speech and religion as natural rights. That protest marked a
          turning point in Roy’s life, away from preoccupation with religious
          polemic and toward social and political action. In his newspapers,
          treatises, and books, Roy tirelessly criticized what he saw as the
          idolatry and superstition of traditional Hinduism. He denounced the
          caste system and attacked the custom of suttee (ritual burning of
          widows upon the funeral pyres of their deceased husbands). His
          writings emboldened the British East India Governing Council to act
          decisively on the matter, leading to the prohibition of suttee in
          1829.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1822 Roy founded the Anglo-Hindu School and four years later the
          Vedanta College in order to teach his Hindu monotheistic doctrines.
          When the Bengal government proposed a more traditional Sanskrit
          college, in 1823, Roy protested that classical Indian literature would
          not prepare the youth of Bengal for the demands of modern life. He
          proposed instead a modern Western curriculum of study. Roy also led a
          protest against the outmoded British legal and revenue administration
          in India.
        </p>
        <p>
          In August 1828 Roy formed the Brahmo Samaj (Society of Brahma), a
          Hindu reformist sect that utilized Unitarian and other liberal
          Christian elements in its beliefs. The Brahmo Samaj was to play an
          important part, later in the century, as a Hindu movement of reform.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1829 Roy journeyed to England as the unofficial representative of
          the titular king of Delhi. The king of Delhi granted him the title of
          raja, though it was unrecognized by the British. Roy was well received
          in England, especially by Unitarians there and by King William IV. Roy
          died of a fever while in the care of Unitarian friends at Bristol,
          where he was buried.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roy’s importance in modern Indian history rests partly upon the broad
          scope of his social vision and the striking modernity of his thought.
          He was a tireless social reformer, yet he also revived interest in the
          ethical principles of the Vedanta school as a counterpoise to the
          Western assault on Indian culture. In his textbooks and treatises he
          contributed to the popularization of the Bengali language, while at
          the same time he was the first Indian to apply to the Indian
          environment the fundamental social and political ideas of the French
          and American revolutions.
